## Cost estimation:

**Estimated cost = hours needed to build an app * cost per hour to build an app.**


## Features

- Logging details about the vehicle.
- View the availabale space in the garage. 
- Display arrival and departure of the vehicle.

## Features to be added in future:

- Integrate GPS routing system with this mobile application to guide the users to vacant position.
- Ability to reserve their space in the garage from mobile application.
- Integrate RFID tag operation with the mobile application for seamless payment facility and update the vehicle occupation within blink of an eye. (fully automated parking system).
